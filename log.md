### Day 1: August 24, 2023 Thursday (sad as a developer i should have started working from day 0 but now day 1 ðŸ˜œ )

**Today's Progress**: Created a shopping cart mini react project to learn more about Context api, clean code and react best practices 

**Thoughts:** Context api concept was transparent clear but needed to learn more about best practices and clean code using Context Api
Read some content on internet and watched some tutorials and developed an shopping cart
